# AUDIT-CRITERIA.md — Compliance Report Generator

> SAAF A2 standard (Audit Criteria & Controls). This document sits next to `README.md`: the README says what the agent does and how to run it; this document says what the agent must be judged against as an auditee.
>
> **Sources used to draft this document:** `README.md`, the hackathon plan (`plans/hackathon-2/rohan-sobha-compliance-report-generator.md` in SAAF-Project), and a read-through of `saaf/core/agent.py`, `saaf/core/models.py`, `saaf/prompts/system_prompt.py`, `config.py`, `cli.py` and `tests/test_saaf.py`. No Session 6 A2 hand-in existed. No logged real run was available, so nothing below is verified by a live run (see section 6).
>
> **Branch note:** `main` is the only live implementation. `origin/rohan-sobha/add-readme` has no diff against `main`.

## Metadata

| Field | Value |

| **Agent** | Compliance Report Generator |
| **Repository** | https://github.com/SAAF-Project/Compliance-Report-Generator |

## 1. What the agent does

Given an engagement profile (company name, industry, country, listed status, audit topic), the agent deterministically maps the entity to applicable regulatory frameworks from a built-in knowledge base (30+ frameworks), then asks Claude (`claude-opus-4-6`, adaptive thinking) to produce a structured compliance overview: mandatory regulations, per-framework control objectives with testing approaches, typical gaps, and a prioritised action summary. Output is validated against Pydantic models and rendered as a terminal report or JSON. It supports the **planning phase** of an audit engagement (regulatory scoping); it does not assess the entity's actual compliance.

The agent makes LLM calls at runtime, so AI-specific frameworks (EU AI Act, OWASP LLM) are in scope below.

## 2. Control objectives & framework mapping

These describe the agent's own trustworthy behaviour, not the regulations it reports on.

| Control objective | Framework + clause/area | Why relevant |
|---|---|---|
| CO-1 — Framework scoping is grounded: every framework in the output comes from the deterministic knowledge base, and the model cannot introduce frameworks of its own. | OWASP LLM Top 10 — LLM09 Overreliance / LLM01 Prompt Injection (constrained output scope); EU AI Act Art. 15 (accuracy, robustness) | The core risk of this agent is a plausible but invented regulation or clause reaching an audit plan. |
| CO-2 — Output is structurally valid and complete: malformed or schema-violating model output is rejected, not silently repaired or passed on. | EU AI Act Art. 15; COBIT 2019 DSS06 (manage business process controls) | Auditors consume the JSON downstream; invalid output must fail loudly. |
| CO-3 — Output is positioned as decision support: a human-review disclaimer always accompanies the report, and model-generated content is not presented as legal or audit-ready conclusions. | EU AI Act Art. 14 (human oversight) & Art. 13 (transparency); IIA Standard 2310 / 1220 (due professional care, reliance on evidence) | Output is generic to a profile and not tested against real entity evidence. |
| CO-4 — Engagement data and secrets are handled safely: API key only from the environment, and no real entity data is needed to use the agent. | GDPR Art. 5(1)(c) & 32 (minimisation, security); ISO 27001 Annex A 5.17 / 8.24; OWASP LLM06 Sensitive Information Disclosure | Company name and profile are sent to a third-party API. |
| CO-5 — Runs are traceable and reproducible enough to review: inputs, selected frameworks, model, and outcome are logged. | EU AI Act Art. 12 (record-keeping); IIA Standard 2330 (documenting information) | A reviewer must be able to see what produced a report. |

## 3. Acceptance criteria (testable, pass/fail)

**CO-1 — Grounded scoping**
- Given a US, private, Healthcare profile, the agent's mapping includes HIPAA and excludes SOX (`--dry-run`, no API call).
- Given an EU, Financial Services profile, the mapping includes GDPR and DORA.
- Given any profile, every `FrameworkMatch` carries a non-empty rationale.
- Given any profile, the system prompt lists only the mapped frameworks and instructs the model not to reference others.
- Given a model response that contains a framework not in the mapped set, the agent flags or rejects it. **Limitation, stated honestly:** this is not implemented today. The restriction is a prompt instruction only, and `framework_assessments` / `mandatory_regulations` are not cross-checked against the mapping (see Coverage gaps).

**CO-2 — Valid output**
- Given a response wrapped in markdown fences or surrounded by prose, the agent extracts the JSON object and validates it.
- Given a response with no JSON object, the agent raises `ComplianceReportError` that carries the raw response.
- Given JSON that violates the schema (e.g. an invalid `risk_rating`), the agent raises `ComplianceReportError` and does not return a partial report.
- Given an invalid `--industry`, `--listed-status` or `--audit-topic`, the CLI exits non-zero without calling the API.
- Given a persistent 4xx API error, the agent fails immediately. Given 5xx or connection errors, it retries up to `max_retries` and then fails with `ComplianceReportError`.

**CO-3 — Decision support, not conclusions**
- Given any successful run, the rendered report and the JSON both contain the disclaimer text.
- Given a model response that omits or rewrites `disclaimer`, the output still carries the standard disclaimer. **Limitation, stated honestly:** not guaranteed today. `disclaimer` is a model field with a default, so a model-supplied value would override it.
- Given any run, the report does not state that the entity is compliant or non-compliant. **Limitation, stated honestly:** only enforced by prompt wording ("typical gaps for this profile"), not by a check.

**CO-4 — Data and secrets**
- Given `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unset, a real run exits with a clear configuration error. `--dry-run` works without a key.
- Given a scan of tracked files, no API keys or credentials are present. A scan found none on 2026-10-06 (patterns `sk-`, `AKIA`, private-key headers, tracked `.env`).
- Given a run, only the five engagement fields are sent to the API. A real (non-dry-run) call prints a stderr warning that `company_name` is sent verbatim (non-blocking; `--yes` / `--no-warn` suppresses it), and `--anonymise` / `--alias NAME` sends a placeholder instead, with the real name restored only in the locally shown `audit_input` and absent from logs. **Limitation, stated honestly:** anonymisation is opt-in, the default still sends the real name, nothing enforces synthetic names, and the other four fields are still sent.

**CO-5 — Traceability**
- Given a run at default log level, stderr logs the input profile, mapped jurisdiction and framework keys, model name, API duration, token counts, stop reason, and the resulting `report_id`.
- Given a JSON output, it includes `report_id`, `generated_at` and the `audit_input`.
- **Limitation, stated honestly:** logs go to stderr only and are not persisted. The model's own response and the prompt are not stored, so a past run cannot be reconstructed.

## 4. Good output / never do

| A correct output MUST contain | The agent must NEVER |
|---|---|
| ✓ Only frameworks that appear in the deterministic mapping, each with the rationale for why it applies | ✕ Invent frameworks, clauses or citations not in the provided knowledge |
| ✓ For each framework: control objectives with a clause reference (`requirement_source`) and a concrete `testing_approach` | ✕ Present output as audit-ready or as a compliance conclusion with no human-review gate |
| ✓ A `gap_risk_summary` with rating, prioritised actions and a plain-English executive summary | ✕ Run commands outside the allowlist (`regulatory/guardrails/allowed-commands.md`) |
| ✓ `report_id`, `generated_at`, the echoed `audit_input`, and the disclaimer | ✕ Hard-code credentials or secrets |
| ✓ Valid JSON conforming to the `ComplianceReport` Pydantic model | ✕ Silently return a partial or schema-invalid report |

Findings do not use `outputs/schemas/finding-schema.json` today. The output is a framework overview, not a findings list (see Coverage gaps).

## 5. Coverage gaps

- **No post-hoc grounding check.** Model output is not compared with the mapped framework set; the restriction relies on the prompt alone.
- **Clause references are unverified.** `requirement_source` and `applicable_sections` are model-generated and not checked against any source text, so a plausible but wrong article number can pass validation.
- **Disclaimer can be overridden** by the model, since it is part of the schema it fills.
- **Knowledge base is hand-maintained and static.** There is no versioning, no review date per framework, and no process for regulatory change. Boundary cases (e.g. a fintech that may or may not be a credit institution under DORA) are listed as an open question in the plan and are not handled explicitly.
- **Limited jurisdiction coverage.** The system prompt names US, EU, UK, Australia and Singapore. Other countries resolve to a generic jurisdiction and the output may be thin.
- **Not mapped to `finding-schema.json`.** Output cannot be fed directly into other SAAF components.
- **Real entity names are sent to a third-party API by default.** A warning and an opt-in alias exist (issue #12), but anonymisation is not the default and the alias is not checked for leaking the real name. Real-name restoration in `audit_input` means local output stays sensitive.
- **No persistent audit trail** (see section 7).
- **Tests are unit-level only.** No test exercises `ComplianceAgent.run` with a mocked or recorded API response, and no test covers a model response with an out-of-scope framework or a rewritten disclaimer. Not evaluated against real model output.
- **Unused config.** `Config.timeout_seconds` is defined but not passed to the API client.
- **Repo ownership.** Plan was submitted on the maintainer's behalf by a colleague; the Check and Act PDCA phases are not started.

## 6. Status / validation

Status is **Draft**. The test suite (`tests/test_saaf.py`, 496 lines, unittest) could not be run while writing this document because dependencies were not installed in that environment, so no criterion below is marked as verified. Tests that appear to cover each criterion are named so a reviewer can run them (`pip install -r requirements.txt && python -m unittest tests.test_saaf`).

| Acceptance criterion | Verified? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| CO-1 #1–#3 (mapping) | ☐ | Candidate tests: `TestFrameworkMapper.test_us_healthcare_includes_hipaa`, `test_us_private_excludes_sox`, `test_eu_finserv_includes_dora`, `test_framework_matches_have_rationale` — not yet run |
| CO-1 #4 (prompt lists only mapped frameworks) | ☐ | Candidate: `TestSystemPromptBuilder.test_system_prompt_injects_framework_names` — not yet run |
| CO-1 #5 (out-of-scope framework rejected) | ☐ | Not implemented |
| CO-2 #1–#2 (JSON extraction) | ☐ | Candidate tests: `TestJsonExtraction.*` — not yet run; no-JSON error path untested |
| CO-2 #3 (schema violation) | ☐ | Candidate: `TestPydanticModels.test_invalid_*_rejected`; agent-level path untested |
| CO-2 #4 (CLI rejects bad enum) | ☐ | Candidate: `TestCliDryRun.test_invalid_industry_rejected_by_cli` — not yet run |
| CO-2 #5 (API retry behaviour) | ☐ | No test |
| CO-3 #1 (disclaimer shown) | ☐ | No test |
| CO-3 #2–#3 | ☐ | Not implemented |
| CO-4 #1 (missing key) | ☐ | Candidate: `TestCliDryRun.test_dry_run_no_api_key_needed` covers dry-run only |
| CO-4 #2 (secret scan) | ☑ | Manual grep of tracked files, 2026-10-06, no matches |
| CO-4 #3 (warning, opt-in alias) | ☑ | `TestEntityNameDataFlow.*` (7 tests, mocked agent, no API call); full suite `python -m unittest discover -s tests` passed, 55 tests. Opt-in only; default still sends real name |
| CO-5 #1–#2 | ☐ | By code inspection (`saaf/core/agent.py`); no test, no live run |
| CO-5 #3 | ☐ | Known limitation |

## 7. Observability

Today: Python `logging` (default INFO, configurable with `--log-level`) writes to stderr. It records the input profile, mapped frameworks, model and token settings, API duration, token counts, stop reason, retries and errors, and the report ID. DEBUG adds prompt sizes and parse details. Missing: persistent log storage, storage of the prompt and raw response per `report_id`, and cost tracking. Input includes the company name, which may be sensitive, so persistence would need a redaction decision.
