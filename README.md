# Compliance Report Generator

Identifies all applicable regulatory frameworks for a financial entity and produces a structured compliance overview to kick off an audit engagement.

## How to run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Interactive mode
python cli.py

# Non-interactive mode
python cli.py \
  --company "Dutch National Bank" \
  --industry "Financial Services" \
  --country Netherlands \
  --listed-status Public \
  --audit-topic Cybersecurity

# Dry-run (no API call — preview framework selection only)
python cli.py --company "..." --industry "Financial Services" \
  --country Netherlands --listed-status Public \
  --audit-topic Cybersecurity --dry-run

# JSON output
python cli.py ... --output json

# SAAF finding-schema export (critical gaps and framework key gaps as findings;
# Critical is mapped to High, see saaf/output/findings.py)
python cli.py ... --output findings
```

### Choosing a model or endpoint

The agent is not tied to one model. Two providers are built in:

| Provider | Use for | Key |
|---|---|---|
| `anthropic` (default) | Anthropic Messages API (default model `claude-opus-4-6`, adaptive thinking) | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `openai` | Any OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` API: OpenAI, Azure-style gateways, vLLM, Ollama, LiteLLM, LM Studio | `OPENAI_API_KEY` (optional when `--base-url` is set) |

```bash
# Default: Anthropic, key from ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
python cli.py ...

# Local model via Ollama (no key needed)
python cli.py ... --provider openai --model llama3.1 --base-url http://localhost:11434/v1

# Hosted OpenAI-compatible gateway
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
python cli.py ... --provider openai --model my-model --base-url https://llm.example.com/v1

# Anthropic through a proxy / gateway
python cli.py ... --base-url https://gateway.example.com/anthropic
```

Each setting can also come from the environment, with precedence **flag > environment > default**: `SAAF_PROVIDER`, `SAAF_MODEL`, `SAAF_BASE_URL`, and `SAAF_API_KEY` (overrides the provider-specific key variable). `--base-url` takes either a base URL (`.../v1`) or the full `.../chat/completions` URL.

Notes:
- The company name and engagement details are sent to whatever endpoint you configure (see `--anonymise`). Plain `http://` to a non-local host logs a warning, since the key and data would travel unencrypted. Redirects are never followed, so the key cannot be forwarded to another host.
- Output quality, JSON compliance and clause accuracy vary by model. Every response is validated against the same schema and grounding checks regardless of provider; only `claude-opus-4-6` has been used so far.
- The openai provider sends `max_tokens` and no provider-specific options (no streaming, no thinking mode).

### Audit trail (opt-in)

`--audit-trail-dir DIR` writes `DIR/<report_id>.json` per successful run (inputs, framework keys, model, SHA-256 of the prompts, timestamps, raw model response). Off by default. The company name is redacted unless `--audit-trail-include-company` is given; the raw response is stored verbatim and may still mention it.

## What it does

1. **Deterministic mapping** — resolves the entity's jurisdiction, industry, and listed status against a knowledge base of 30+ frameworks (DORA, NIS2, GDPR, ISO 27001, SOX, HIPAA, and more) with no API call needed (`saaf/core/mapper.py`, `saaf/knowledge/`).
2. **Dynamic prompt construction** — builds a system prompt containing only the selected frameworks, reducing hallucination (`saaf/prompts/system_prompt.py`).
3. **LLM call** — sends the engagement details to the configured model (default Claude `claude-opus-4-6` with adaptive thinking; any OpenAI-compatible endpoint is supported) and retries on transient errors (`saaf/core/agent.py`, `saaf/core/llm.py`).
4. **Validation and rendering** — validates the JSON response against Pydantic models and renders a rich terminal report with control objectives, gap analysis, and priority actions (`saaf/core/models.py`, `saaf/output/formatter.py`).

## Input / output

- **Input**: company name, industry (e.g. `Financial Services`, `Healthcare`), country/jurisdiction, listed status (`Public` / `Private` / `Government`), audit topic (e.g. `Cybersecurity`, `Data Privacy`, `Financial Reporting`)
- **Output**: rich terminal report or JSON listing applicable regulatory frameworks, control objectives, key gaps, and priority remediation actions

## Data flow

Only the five engagement fields (company name, industry, country, listed status, audit topic) are sent to Anthropic's API, together with a system prompt built from the mapped frameworks. `--dry-run` sends nothing.

- `company_name` is sent **verbatim**. A real (non-dry-run) call prints a warning on stderr; it does not prompt or block. Suppress it with `--yes` (alias `--no-warn`) in non-interactive use.
- `--anonymise` (or `--alias NAME`, which implies it) sends a placeholder (default `Entity A`) instead. The real name stays on your machine, and logs show only the alias. The `audit_input` in the report shown or saved locally has the real name restored, so treat that output as sensitive. Industry, country, listed status and audit topic are still sent.
- Prefer synthetic or anonymised names for testing.

## Supported jurisdictions

The knowledge base targets **US, EU (incl. EEA member countries), UK, Australia and Singapore**. Canada, India and Japan have minimal partial coverage. Any other country resolves to a generic global framework set, so output may be thin. In that case the CLI prints a warning to stderr (also with `--dry-run`), a warning is logged, and the report carries a visible warning (`warnings` field in JSON).

CI (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) runs the same suite on every pull request and push to `main`, and posts a short test report as a PR comment and job summary. The suite makes no API calls.
